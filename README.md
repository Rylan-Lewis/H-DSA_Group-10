# H-DSA_Group-10: Candidate Compatibility Score based on RAG model for Resume and Job description matching
The increasing volume of job applications and candidate profiles necessitates an efficient and intelligent recruitment process. This project aims to develop a candidate-job recommendation system leveraging machine learning and vector-based search to automate the matching of candidates with relevant job opportunities. The system follows a structured pipeline consisting of four key stages: (1) Data Collection and Processing, where candidate skill graphs and resumes are retrieved from a PostgreSQL database, preprocessed, and stored; (2) Embedding Generation, utilizing Google Generative AI Embeddings and text chunking techniques to convert structured and unstructured candidate and job data into high-dimensional vectors; (3) Vector Storage and Retrieval, where embeddings are indexed in ChromaDB to enable fast and efficient similarity searches; and (4) Candidate-Job Matching, employing semantic search and similarity scoring to rank and recommend the best-fit candidates for job descriptions and vice versa. By integrating LangChain and ChromaDB, this system significantly enhances recruitment efficiency, reducing manual effort while improving accuracy in talent acquisition.
